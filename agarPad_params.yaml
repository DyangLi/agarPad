### Experimental information
# This will be used to identify the experiment when saving the output data
experiment_name: 'crop_experiment_1'
# Path to .tif files
path_to_tiffs: '/Users/jt/drive/code/agarPad/fewTIFF/'

# Boolean values indicating what type of analysis should be done.
meas_pc: True # Do threshold based phase contrast size analysis
meas_int: True # Do fluorecence intensity analysis

# Quality control or debug mode Boolean
qc: False

# Image cropping. Indicate if the imaged should be cropped before analysis. The
# values indicate what part of the image should be analyzed. For example,
# row_start = 0, row_end = 1, col_start = 0, col_end 0.5, would be the top
# half of the image.
crop_image: True
row_start: 0.25 # value between 0 and 1, measured from image left edge
row_end: 0.75 # value between 0 and 1, greater than row_start
col_start: 0.25 # value between 0 and 1, measured from image top edge
col_end: 0.75 # value between 0 and 1, greater than row_start

# pixel to micron conversion
pxl2um: 0.065

### Contour filtering parameters
# These parameters remove contours (suspected cells) based on size and shape,
# which come into play during intial contour finding (not during phase contrast
# sizing or fluorescent analysis).

# If cells are with this number of pixels from the edge of the image (after
# cropping), they will be removed. This excludes cells that may be cut off by
# the image edge.
boundary: 20

# If the contour has an area less than this value in square pixels, discard.
min_area: 100

# If the ratio of the area of a bounding box around the countour to the area of
# the actual countour is greater than this value, discard. This excludes cells
# that do not lie straight or have a funny shape.
rect_to_area: 1.5

# Aspect ratio limits (length/width)
min_aspect_ratio: 1.2
max_aspect_ratio: 15

# Countour width and length limits, all are in pixels
con_min_w: 5 # min width
con_max_w: 23 # max width
con_min_l: 5 # min length
con_max_l: 100 # max length

### Phase contrast size analysis parameters
# These parameters are used during phase contrast sizing.
# threshold from 0 to 1 to decide where cell boundary is during phase contrast
# sizing
pc_int_thr: 0.75

# width based measures
wth_cut_up: 1.4 # upper bound of acceptable cell width in microns
wth_cut_low: 0.6 # lower bound of acceptable cell width in microns

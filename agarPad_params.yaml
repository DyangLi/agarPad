# Parameter file for agarPad.py imaging script.

### Experimental information
experiment_name: 'put_name_here'

path_to_tiffs: '/Users/jt/drive/code/agarPad/fewTIFF'



### Contour filtering parameters
# These parameters remove contours (suspected cells) based on size and shape,
# which come into play during intial contour finding (not during phase contrast
# sizing or fluorescent analysis).

# If cells are with this number of pixels from the edge of the image (after
# cropping), they will be removed. This excludes cells that may be cut off by
# the image edge.
boundary: 20

# If the contour has an area less than this value in square pixels, discard.
min_area: 100

# If the ratio of the area of a bounding box around the countour to the area of
# the actual countour is greater than this value, discard. This excludes cells
# that do not lie straight or have a funny shape.
rect_to_area: 1.5

# Aspect ratio limits (length/width)
min_aspect_ratio: 1.2
max_aspect_ratio: 15

# Countour width and length limits, all are in pixels
con_min_w: 5 # min width
con_max_w: 23 # max width
con_min_l: 5 # min length
con_max_l: 100 # max length

### Phase contrast size analysis parameters
# These parameters are used during phase contrast sizing.
pc_int_thr: 0.75

wth_cut_up: 1.4

wth_cut_low: 0.6
